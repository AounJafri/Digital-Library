## About The Website
It is a great and fun website built on Node, Express, PostgreSQL and most importantly uses a Public API in the backend.The website allows you to keep track of and organize the books you read.You can perform various operations like Adding, Editing, Deleting newbooks.It uses a public API to generate book covers based on ISBN and in different sizes too Like small, large,and medium.It has great and fancy user interface and looks very professional.This website is one of my best works untill now.
